# CVE-Resources
  A list of URLs for security advisories and common-vulnerability-enumeration information (CVEs) to ease the process of finding free, fresh and reliable information about product vulnerabilities and related OSINT processes.

## Motivation

Finding up-to-date vulnerability information is still problematic and time consuming. The provided resources should help IT-people and users to identify resource and especially support the security life-cycle management. Enabling user to run OSINT without additional costs is a key function to IT security management.

## Focus

  The initial focus is Enterprise IT incl. industry automation, related Software and cost free resources.

## State

Currently the 136 CVE-Resources include 29 Meta-Databases of which 5 Meta-Databases hold PoC/Exploit (e.g., KEV - Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) related information, and 105 Supplier-spezific resources.  

## Entries

  There are 2 types of entries.
  Direct resources from a project or company e.g., Ubuntu
  Secondary resources of (free to accees) meta-cve-database like OpenCVE.io
  The type is indicated by "type" field of the JSON object.

## Contribution
  Feel free to add resources 

    1.) that are meaningful
    2.) validated to be not malicious
    3.) uptodate and maintain

  and that are
  
    4.) not already part of the list
    5.) reliable and trustworthy 
    6.) free to access
    
  and feel free to remove/replace resource that
  
    7.) are malicious
    8.) pay-walled
    9.) out of maintenance

## Structure
Initially an object will provide 4 fields, those are 

  1. Supplier - a mandatory string for the information provider and/or product supplier. 
  2. Location (URL, RSSFeed, etc.)  - a mandatory string indicating the information source. 
  3. Comments - an optional string - describing the resource. 
  4. Type - either "supplier-specific" or "meta-database"

## Data Formats

The initial dataformat is JSON. The list is an Array/list of Objects, the Objects has the listed 4 attributes. 

### Schema

Array [

  {Key-Value-Pair1, Key-Value-Pair2, Key-Value-Pair3, Key-Value-Pair4},
  
  {Key-Value-Pair1, Key-Value-Pair2, Key-Value-Pair3, Key-Value-Pair4}
  
]  

### CSV-Format 
CSV version is available in file cve_resource_list_alpha.csv

CSV version is comma (,) separated.

CSV includes Header-Information.

Order of attributes is Supplier,location,comment,type.

### HTML-Format
Autogeneratable HTML formate CVE resource collection is available in cveresources_fetched_DD-MM-YYYY.html.

## Tools

### Scrappi.pl
<img src="https://github.com/BoaThor/CVE-Resources/blob/main/scrappi.jpg" width="100">
Scrappi is a minimal web-scraper. The idea behind scrabbi is to identify changes to websites, such as static CVE and Security Advisory link lists.
Scrappi reads the CVE-resources JSON from this repository. Scraps all URLs (from the "location" field). Creates a MD5 checksum of the fetched BLOB than 
Stores all of it in a local DB (urls.db), writes error during processing to scrabbi_error.log and detected changes to scrabbi_change.log.
A detected change indicates that the URLs content might have changed e.g., new CVEs added. 
This does not work for dynamically created pages (like GitHub hosted Advisory Boards) and web-application DB interfaces (for obvious reasons).

Scrappi can also be used to monitor a JSON formated list of static web-pages for any kind of changes e.g., defacing, hijacking or just identifying changes on your favorite blogs.
It also measures performance - how long did the fetching took - and can indicate performance issues.  

Scrappi works on Linux and Windows systems with Perl 5.38.2 and uses standard pre-packed Perl libraries such as DBI and Time:HiRes.

If you want to improve Scrappi get in touch.

### CVE-resources-http-status-check.pl
Perl written HTML-generator CVE-resources-http-status-check.pl is available. The tool fetches the most recent release of cve_resources_list_alpha_sorted.JSON, checks all location URLs listed in the JSON file, and generates an output-file cveresources_fetched_<DD-MM-YYYY>.html containing the HTTP response code of each URL. The output-file has plain simple HTML format.

Check availability, accessibility and changes of for CVE-resources (URLs, URIs) is required to maintain an up-to-date list of resources. 
An updated version of the output of the status generator will be generated and provided on this project from time to time.

Status Code 404 and 500 indicates issues with the resource location. Status 200 indicates ok. Status 403 indicates authorization might be required. 

To execute the tool a recent version of the Perl 5 interpreter is required. Download the file JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl and
execute "perl CVE-resources-http-status-check.pl". Tested with Strawberry Perl 5.38.2. Should work on Windows as well as Linux.
Perl and contained libraries should be in path variable.

### JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl
Perl written HTML-generator JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl is available. The tool fetches the most recent release of cve_resources_list_alpha_sorted.JSON and generates the output-file cveresources_fetched_<DD-MM-YYYY>.html 
in plain simple HTML format.

To execute the tool a recent version of the Perl 5 interpreter is required. Download the file JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl and
execute "perl JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl". Tested with Strawberry Perl 5.38.2. Should work on Windows as well as Linux.
Perl and contained libraries should be in path variable.

### Further Formats
Feel free to add other machine readable formats e.g., YML, XML, Bookmarks
or even databases-table-dumps like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and other Key-Value-Stores.

## Call to Action
Please, feel free to contribute, maintain and keep up-to-date. Any help welcome.
