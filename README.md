# CVE-Resources
  A list of URLs for security advisories and common-vulnerability-enumeration information (CVEs) to     ease the process of finding free, fresh and reliable information about product vulnerabilities.

## Motivation

Finding up-to-date vulnerability information is still problematic and time consuming. The provided resources should help IT-people and users to identify resource and especially support the security life-cycle management. Enabling user to run OSINT without additional costs is a key function to IT security management.

## Focus

  The initial focus is Enterprise IT and related Software and cost free resources.

## State

Currently the CVE-Resources include, 14 Meta-Databases of which 2 Meta-Databases hold PoC/Exploit related information, and 59 Supplier-spezific resources.  

## Entries

  There are 2 types of entries.
  Direct resources from a project or company e.g., Ubuntu
  Secondary resources of (free to accees) meta-cve-database like OpenCVE.io
  The type is indicated by "type" field of the JSON object.

## Contribution
  Feel free to add resources 

    1.) that are meaningful
    2.) validated to be not malicious
    3.) uptodate and maintain

  and that are
  
    4.) not already part of the list
    5.) reliable and trustworthy 
    6.) free to access
    
  and feel free to remove/replace resource that
  
    7.) are malicious
    8.) pay-walled
    9.) out of maintenance

## Structure
Initially an object will provide 4 fields, those are 

  1. Supplier - a mandatory string for the information provider and/or product supplier. 
  2. Location (URL, RSSFeed, etc.)  - a mandatory string indicating the information source. 
  3. Comments - an optional string - describing the resource. 
  4. Type - either "supplier-specific" or "meta-database"

## Data Formats

The initial dataformat is JSON. The list is an Array/list of Objects, the Objects has the listed 4 attributes. 

### Schema

Array [

  {Key-Value-Pair1, Key-Value-Pair2, Key-Value-Pair3, Key-Value-Pair4},
  
  {Key-Value-Pair1, Key-Value-Pair2, Key-Value-Pair3, Key-Value-Pair4}
  
]  

### CSV-Format 
CSV version is available in file cve_resource_list_alpha_CSV 

CSV version is comma (,) separated.

CSV includes Header-Information.

Order of attributes is Supplier,location,comment,type.

### HTML-Format
Autogeneratable HTML formate CVE resource collection is available in cveresources_fetched_DD-MM-YYYY.html.

## Tools

### JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl
Perl written HTML-generator JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl is available. The tool fetches the most recent release of cve_resources_list_alpha_sorted.JSON and generates the output-file cveresources_fetched_<DD-MM-YYYY>.html 
in plain simple HTML format.

To execute the tool a recent version of the Perl 5 interpreter is required. Download the file JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl and
execute "perl JSON2HTM_Formatter.pl". Tested with Strawberry Perl 5.38.2. Should work on Windows as well as Linux.
Perl and contained libraries should be in path variable.

### Further Formats
Feel free to add other machine readable formats e.g., YML, XML, Bookmarks
or even databases-table-dumps like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and other Key-Value-Stores.

## Call to Action
Please, feel free to contribute, maintain and keep up-to-date. Any help welcome.

Thanks, Boa
